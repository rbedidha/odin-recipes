        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        A grilled cheese sandwich is a simple, comforting dish made by placing cheese between two slices of bread and
        grilling or toasting it until the bread is golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is melted. It's often cooked
        with butter on the outside of the bread to enhance flavor and crispiness.
